This application needs the Oracle Java 11 JDK and MySQL 5.6 or higher to run.

For setting up MySQL, create a database called `tpmis` in a locally installed server, then create a user called `devfactory` with password `devfactory`.

For testing the web application locally, you will need to access it through the URL `lvh.me` instead of `localhost` and a Google account to login, or else the application will not authenticate correctly.
